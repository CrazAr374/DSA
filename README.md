## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data structure that store elements in a contiguous memory location. They are widely used for various applications, including searching and sorting algorithms.
- **Topics**: Basic operations, Sorting, Searching, Kadane’s Algorithm, etc.

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next. Linked lists are dynamic in nature and are used in various applications like queues, stacks, and graphs.
- **Topics**: Single Linked List, Double Linked List, Circular Linked List, etc.

### Stacks and Queues
Stacks and queues are abstract data types that store elements in a particular order. A stack follows Last In First Out (LIFO) while a queue follows First In First Out (FIFO).
- **Topics**: Stack operations, Queue operations, Applications in recursion, etc.

### Hashing
Hashing is a technique used to map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. It is widely used in database indexing, cache mechanisms, and associative arrays.
- **Topics**: Hash functions, Collision resolution techniques, Hash maps, etc.

### Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. They are used in various applications like databases, file systems, and network routing.
- **Topics**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Tree traversals, etc.

### Heaps
A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are widely used in priority queues and graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s.
- **Topics**: Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Heap sort, etc.

### Graphs
Graphs are a collection of nodes connected by edges and are used to model pairwise relationships between objects. Graphs are fundamental in computer science, with applications in networks, social networks, and more.
- **Topics**: Graph representations, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s algorithm, etc.

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is widely used in optimization problems.
- **Topics**: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.

### Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. They are used in optimization problems where the solution can be constructed incrementally.
- **Topics**: Huffman Coding, Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm, etc.

### Backtracking
Backtracking is a method for solving problems by exploring all possible solutions and abandoning those that do not satisfy the problem's constraints. It is often used in puzzles and games.
- **Topics**: N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver, Hamiltonian Path, etc.

### Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation involves the algorithmic manipulation of data at the bit level. It is a powerful tool used in cryptography, network protocols, and more.
- **Topics**: Bitwise operations, Counting set bits, Power of two checks, etc.

### String Algorithms
String algorithms deal with the processing of strings, including searching, matching, and manipulating sequences of characters.
- **Topics**: KMP Algorithm, Rabin-Karp Algorithm, Longest Common Substring, etc.

### Trie (Prefix Tree)
A Trie is a tree-like data structure that is used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. It is often used in autocomplete and spell-checking applications.
- **Topics**: Insertion, Searching, Prefix matching, etc.

### Segment Trees
Segment trees are advanced data structures that allow querying and updating range-based data in logarithmic time. They are widely used in interval problems.
- **Topics**: Range sum queries, Lazy propagation, etc.

### Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
Union-Find is a data structure that keeps track of elements partitioned into disjoint sets. It is used in network connectivity, image processing, and more.
- **Topics**: Path compression, Union by rank, Applications in graph algorithms, etc.
